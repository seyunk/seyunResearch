 Hi! I'm a (rising) third year Ph.D. student in School of Computer Science <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/phd-hci" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HCII</a> at Carnegie Mellon University advised by <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/motahhare-eslami" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Motahhare Eslami</a> and <a href="https://haiyizhu.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Haiyi Zhu</a>.             
  My research goal is to understand how to operationalize values such as equity and fairness in data-driven technologies and artificial intelligence.
  My current project involves understanding what embedding fairness means in technology and surfacing different perceptions from various stakeholders.


  Previously, I received my  <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/ms" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Master of Science (M.S.) in Computer Science </a> at Cornell University.  I was advised by [Malte Jung](https://mjung.infosci.cornell.edu/) and  <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/fussell" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Susan Fussell </a>.

  I received my B.S. at Cornell University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Information Science.
