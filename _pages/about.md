 Hi! I'm a 4th year Ph.D. student in School of Computer Science <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/phd-hci" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HCII</a> at Carnegie Mellon University advised by <a href="https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/people/motahhare-eslami" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Motahhare Eslami</a> and <a href="https://haiyizhu.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Haiyi Zhu</a>.             

 I design and develop AI systems for high-stakes domains such as healthcare and the public sector, with a focus on integrating human values into data-driven technologies. My research explores how values are understood by diverse stakeholders and how they can be meaningfully embedded into the design and deployment of AI.

 Currently, Iâ€™m working in the healthcare space - particularly in the context of breast cancer risk prediction tools. auditing model performance, and developing interventions to support patient and clinicians' needs.


Previously, I received my  <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/ms" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Master of Science (M.S.) in Computer Science </a> at Cornell University.  I was advised by [Malte Jung](https://mjung.infosci.cornell.edu/) and  <a href="https://infosci.cornell.edu/content/fussell" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Susan Fussell </a>.

I received my B.S. at Cornell University majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Information Science.

My email is seyunkim[at]cs.cmu.edu
